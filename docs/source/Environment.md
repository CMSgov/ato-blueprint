## Environment Settings

### top-level keys

- `admins`
- `branding`: used for [custom branding](Custombranding.html)
- `db`: if supplied, this is the DB connection used. See [DB configuration](configure_db.html).
- `debug`: should be `false` or absent in production environments. If set to `true`, turns on certain debug/development settings.
- `email` <!-- this seems to be a multi-level key -->
- `govready_cms_api_auth`
- `host`: this is the domain name (HTTP `Host` header) used for root-level GovReady-Q pages. See also `organization-parent-domain`, which is used to construct organization subdomains (and which has a different default value!).
- `https`
- `mailgun_api_key`
- `memcached`
- `organization-parent-domain`: this is the domain name (HTTP `Host` header) suffix used for organization-specific GovReady-Q pages. The default value is `localhost:80`, regardless of the value supplied for `host` - if you have set the `host` key, and intend to use organization subdomains, you will almost certainly want to set `organization-parent-domain` as well.
- `organization-seen-anonymously`
- `secret-key`
- `single-organization`
- `static`
- `syslog`
- `trust-user-authentication-headers`

### Production Deployment Environment Settings

A production system deployment may need to set more options in `local/environment.json`. Here are recommended settings:

	{
	  "debug": false,
	  "admins": [["Name", "email@domain.com"], ...],
	  "host": "q.<yourdomain>.com",
	  "https": true,
	  "organization-parent-domain": "<yourdomain>.com",
	  "organization-seen-anonymously": false,
	  "secret-key": "something random here",
	  "static": "/root/public_html"
	}

### Enterprise Single-Sign On Environment Settings

GovReady-Q supports Enterprise Login via IAM (Identity and Access Management). In this configuration, GovReady-Q is deployed behind a reverse proxy that authenticates users and passes the authenticated userâ€™s username and email address in HTTP headers.

To activate reverse proxy authentication, add the header names used by the proxy to your `local/environment.json`, e.g.:

  {
    "trust-user-authentication-headers": {
      "username": "X-Authenticated-User-Username",
      "email": "X-Authenticated-User-Email"
    },
  }


GovReady-Q must be run at a private address that cannot be accessed except through the proxy server. The proxy server must be configured to proxy to GovReady-Q's private address. See [Enterprise Single-Sign On / Login](enterprise_sso.html) for additional details.

### Custom Branding Environment Settings

You may override the templates and stylesheets that are used for GovReady-Q's branding by adding a new key named `branding` that is the name of an installed Django app Python module (i.e. created using `manage.py startapp`) that holds templates and static files. See [Applying Custom Organization Branding](CustomBranding.html).
