GovReady-Q Documentation
========================

.. IMPORTANT::
   SECURITY ADVISORY: Due to high-severity vulnerabilities in the version of Django that is incorporated into GovReady-Q version 0.8.6, we encourage all users to upgrade to GovReady-Q version 0.9.0 or later as soon as possible.

The GovReady-Q Compliance Server is an open source GRC platform for highly automated, user-friendly, self-service compliance assessments and documentation. It's perfect for DevSecOps.

GovReady-Q solves the painful compliance bottleneck of needing months to authorize applications that deploy and redeploy in minutes.

The code is open source, and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/GovReady/govready-q).

.. ATTENTION::
   GovReady-Q is in Beta. Suggested for DevSecOps early adopters needing Compliance-as-Code.
