    Rules of Behavior 

    In this module, we'll ask you to describe the responsibilities and expected behavior of users
    and administrators of your organization's information systems and devices.

    {% if project.general_info.exists == "no" %}
    You said your organization's Rules of Behavior don't exist. We'll draft a version from your answers to these questions.
    {% endif %}
    
    This information will {% if project.general_info.exists == "no" %}also{% endif %} be used to describe the essense of your rules in your compliance documentation for auditors.

    Motivation
    ==========
    {{organization}}'s of staff, contractors, and all those who have access to {{organization}}’s systems must uphold acceptable security practices while interacting with {{organization}}’s systems, and while handling {{organization}}’s information. These practices provide practical guidance, designed to ensure that {{organization}}’s systems and information remain protected while {{organization}} staff and contractors carry out their responsibilities.

    Information Handling
    ====================

    ### Passwords and Authentication
    {{organization}} uses strong passwords and keeps them safe at all times. {{organization}} requires passwords used for work-related accounts, including systems owned by {{organization}} and from external providers. Passwords used for GovReady-related accounts, including systems owned by {{organization}} and from external providers, must be strong and difficult to guess or computationally expensive to crack. 

    {{organization}} uses two Factor Authentication for all systems that support it. The use of an authenticator application, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, is recommended over use of SMS for Two Factor Authentication.

    {{organization}} requires SSH keys be protected with passphrases and the passphrase is either memorized or stored in approved Password Management software.

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > You are responsible for the management of your account credentials and the quality of your passwords.
    > 
    > Use two Factor Authentication for all systems that support it. The use of an authenticator application, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, is recommended over use of SMS for Two Factor Authentication.

    > 
    > Store your passwords only in an approved Password Manager.
    > 
    > | Approved Password Managers | Website                                  |
    > |:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
    > | LastPass                   | https://www.lastpass.com                 |

    > | Apple Keychain             | https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085 |
    > 
    > Pick unique, difficult to guess passwords. Passwords must:
    > 
    > - Be at least 10 characters long
    > - Not be used for any other accounts, including personal accounts
    > - Be kept secret
    > - Not be written down or stored anywhere except in approved Password Management software
    > 
    > Do not share credentials or passwords with other people except where individuals are require access to the same account for redunancy and the credentials are shared only through an approved Password Manager.
    > 
    > Do not transmitted passwords via email, SMS (text message) or instant messaging services except under special circumsntances such as providing credentials to a new account and the password will be immediately changed.

    ### Sensitive Information
    {{organization}} always handles with due care and does not share with unauthorized parties information regarding the internal operation of {{organization}} and {{organization}} clients. This includes emails, slack communications, details of internal discussions, documents and information relating to our clients.

    {{organization}} staff and contractors only use tools provided by or identified and approved by {{organization}}, for example G-Suite and slack, to share information marked or identified as confidential.

    {{organization}} does not handle any on any of its systems information identified by the U.S. government as Classified.

    {{organization}} has established controls for handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in accordance to NIST Special Publication 800-171.

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > You are a stewart of {{organization}} sensitive information. 
    > 
    > - {{organization}} will only be disclosed to you with prior authorisation.
    > - Disclose {{organization}} to others with prior authorization.
    > - Return all {{organization}} you have in your possession upon the conclusion of your business relationship with {{organization}}, including any notes or paper records that belong to {{organization}} or {{organization}} clients.
    > - Use tools provided by or identified and approved by {{organization}}, for example G-Suite and slack, to share information marked or identified as confidential.
    > 
    > {{organization}} does not handle any on any of its systems information identified by the U.S. government as Classified.

    ### Client Data
    {{organization}} considers client data, and data from production systems to be especially sensitive and handled with additional care. {{organization}} always encrypts client data in transit, and at rest (for example on an encrypted hard drive). {{organization}} does not transmit client data via email, unless requested explicitly by the client, and instead uses secure file sharing services. {{organization}} data securely archives and/or destroys client information as soon as it is no longer required to provide customer support or for legal requirements.

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > You are a stewart of client information.
    > 
    > - Encrypted in transit, and at rest (for example on an encrypted hard drive). Do not store client data on a computer that doesnothave an encrypted hard drive.
    > - Do not share sensitive or proprietary client data via email. 
    > - Do not transmit client data via any network, unless it is encrypted in traffic.
    > - Share sensitive or proprietary client detail via secure file sharing service identified by the client of {{organization}}. This may take a couple of minutes longer, but you will have less worries.
    > - Securely destroy client sensitive or proprietary data as soon as it is no longer required to provide customer support.
    > - Store client data in Google Drive only if client approves.

    ### Clear Screen
    {{organization}} requires devices be protected while unattended. 

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > - Lock computing devices (e.g. computer, mobile phone) when they are unattended.
    > - Configure computing devices (e.g. computer, mobile phone) to autolock after a few minutes while unattended.
    > - Immediately remove sensitive or classified information from printers.

    Computing devices
    =================

    ### Ownership

    - All computers and mobile devices issued to staff remain the property of {{organization}}. 
    - {{organization}} takes no responsibility for personal devices used for work purposes.

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > - Remember all computers and mobile devices issued to staff remain the property of {{organization}}. 
    > - You are responsible for personal devices that you use for work purposes.
    > - Employees, contractors, and other staff must surrender all {{organization}} computers and mobile devices upon the conclusion of their business relationship with {{organization}}.


    ### Password Protection
    All devices (workstations, laptops and mobile devices) must require a login password.

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > Configure your {{organization}} devices to require a login password.

    ### Device Encryption
    All devices (workstations, laptops and mobile devices) must have device (disk) encryption enabled.

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > Encryption of storage devices has become very reliable and very insvisible.
    > 
    > - Enable storage/disk encryption on all {{organization}} devices.
    > - Enable storage/disk encryption on all personal devices that may hold {{organization}} information.
    > - Encrypt any personal information about your relationship with {{organization}} that you store on personal devices.
    > - Store any decryption recovery key codes in secure and separate location from where your {{organization}} devices live.

    ### Patching
    All devices (workstations, laptops and mobile devices) must be patched and kept up to date. Applying patches and updates is the responsibility of the operator of the device, and patches must be applied within one week of release. Critical security patches must be applied immediately. It is highly recommended that automatic updates are enabled on workstations, laptops and mobile devices.

    > #### Practices for Individuals
    > 
    > You are responsible for applying software patches to {{organization}} devices in your trust.
    > It is OK to prioritize updating patches over other work deliverables for {{organization}}. 


    Information Systems
    ===================

    ### Email, Slack, Social Media Communications
    Communications sent from {{organization}}’s email, slack or Social Media systems impact on the reputation of the company. The content of such communications should be professional.
