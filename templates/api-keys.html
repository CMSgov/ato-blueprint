	<h1>Your API Keys</h1>

	<p>Your API keys allow you to programmatically access and update your system data on Q.</p>

	<p>Your three API keys are:</p>

	<dl>

	<dt>Read-only key</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><code>{{api_key_ro}}</code></p>
	<p>Your read-only key gives external tools the ability to see anything you can see on Q but those tools cannot make any changes.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Full access key</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><code>{{api_key_rw}}</code></p>
	<p>Your full access key gives external tools the ability to see and make changes to anything you can see and make changes to on Q.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Write-only key</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><code>{{api_key_wo}}</code></p>
	<p>Your write-only key gives external tools the ability to make changes to anything you can make changes to on Q but does not include the abiliy to see any data values stored in Q. The write-only key is useful in situations where the external tool needs to be able to upload data but does not need to read existing data values.</p>
	</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>Choose the API key that is most appropriate for the acccess level required by the external application.</p>
