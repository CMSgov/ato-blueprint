# A CircleCI configuration file because we do continuous integration testing!

machine:
  python:
    version: 3.5.2 # matches Python version in Ubuntu 16.04 in deployment

dependencies:
  pre:
    # For good measure? Not sure this is really necessary.
    - pip install --upgrade pip
  # CircleCI will run `pip install requirements.txt` automatically at this stage.
  post:
    - ./fetch-vendor-resources.sh
  cache_directories:
    - siteapp/static/vendor # created the first time by fetch-vendor-resources.sh

test:
  # CircleCI would automatically run `manage.py test` but our Selenium
  # tests take a long time and CircleCI will timeout if there's no
  # console output after 10 minutes. So we split the tests up into
  # multiple commands.

    - ./requirements_txt_checker.sh

    - ./manage.py test siteapp.tests.LandingSiteFunctionalTests
